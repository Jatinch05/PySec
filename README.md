# pysec

A concise toolkit of practical Python utilities for cybersecurity tasks. Each tool is CLI-driven, testable, and designed for realistic lab use. Use responsibly and only on assets you own or are authorized to test.

## What this repository contains

* **Port scanner** — high-performance TCP connect scanner with multithreading, banner grabbing, and export options.
* **Recon** — domain reconnaissance including HTTP metadata, DNS enumeration, whois, and subdomain enumeration.
* **Packet sniffer** — Scapy-based capture with lightweight alerting rules (example: SYN-rate detection).
* **File analyzer** — hashing, PE introspection, and YARA scanning for basic static analysis.
* **Mini SIEM** — integration layer that ingests events, matches indicators, and emits alerts.
* **Data** — supporting assets such as wordlists and threat indicator feeds.
* **Tests** — unit tests for core functionality and integration checks.

## Core technologies used

`socket`, `ipaddress`, `threading`, `asyncio` (optional), `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `dnspython`, `scapy`, `pefile`, `yara-python`, `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `argparse`, `logging`.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/pysec.git
cd pysec
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # Linux / macOS
.\.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows PowerShell
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run any tool with `--help` to see available options:

```bash
python tools/port_scanner.py --help
```

## Validation checklist

* Scanner completes a /24 scan within reasonable time and exports results.
* Recon produces structured output with DNS, HTTP headers, and whois information.
* Sniffer generates at least one synthetic alert under test traffic.
* File analyzer yields correct hashes and enumerates PE imports for Windows binaries.
* Mini SIEM ingests events and writes alerts for matching indicators.

## Security and ethics

Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Handle malware samples and indicators in isolated, controlled environments.
